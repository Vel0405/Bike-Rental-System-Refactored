# Bike-Rental-System
#### Bike rental system implemented in Python using object oriented programming.

## Customers can
See available bikes on the shop<br>
Rent bikes on hourly basis $5 per hour.<br>
Rent bikes on daily basis $20 per day.<br>
Rent bikes on weekly basis $60 per week.<br>
Family Rental, a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price

## The rental shops can
issue a bill when customer decides to return the bike.<br>
display available inventory<br>
take requests on hourly, daily and weekly basis by cross verifying stock<br>
Since classes are used various customers and bike rental shops can be instantiated as needed.<br>

For simplicity we assume that any customer requests rentals of only one type i.e hourly, monthly or weekly but is free to chose the number of bikes he/she wants. However requested bikes should be less than available stock.
